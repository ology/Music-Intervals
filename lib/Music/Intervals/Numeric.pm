=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Music::Intervals::Numeric;
  $m = Music::Intervals::Numeric->new(
    notes => [qw( 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8 )],
    size => 3,
    freq => 1,
    interval => 1,
    cent => 1,
    prime => 1,
  );
  $m->process;
  # Then print Dumper any of:
  $m->frequencies;
  $m->intervals;
  $m->cent_vals;
  $m->prime_factor;

  # Show all the known intervals (the "notes" attribute above):
  perl -MData::Dumper -MMusic::Intervals::Ratio -e'print Dumper $Music::Intervals::Ratio::ratio'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Music::Intervals> object shows the mathematical break-down of musical
intervals and chords.

This module reveals the "guts" of chords within a given tonality.  By guts I
mean, the measurements of the notes and the intervals between them, in just
intonation.

=head2 Attributes and defaults

=over

=item cent: 0 - divisions of the octave

=item freq: 0 - frequencies

=item interval: 0 - note intervals

=item prime: 0 - prime factorization

=item size: 3 - chord size

=item semitones: 12 - number of notes in the scale

=item temper: semitones * 100 / log(2) - physical distance between notes

=item notes: [ 1/1 5/4 3/2 ] - C E G - actual notes to use in the computation

The list of notes may be any of the keys in the L<Music::Intervals::Ratio>
C<ratio> hashref.  This is very very long and contains useful intervals such as
those of the common scale and even the Pythagorean intervals, too.
