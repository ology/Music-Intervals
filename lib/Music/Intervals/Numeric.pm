=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Music::Intervals::Numeric;
  $m = Music::Intervals::Numeric->new(
    notes => [qw( 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8 )],
    size => 3,
    freq => 1,
    interval => 1,
    cent => 1,
    prime => 1,
  );
  $m->process;
  # Then print Dumper any of:
  $m->frequencies;
  $m->intervals;
  $m->cent_vals;
  $m->prime_factor;

  # Show all the known intervals:
  perl -MData::Dumper -MMusic::Intervals::Ratio -e'print Dumper $Music::Intervals::Ratio::ratio'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Music::Intervals> object shows the mathematical break-down of musical
intervals and chords.

This module reveals the "guts" of chords within a given tonality.  By guts I
mean, the measurements of the notes and the intervals between them, in just
intonation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 cent

Show divisions of the octave

Default: 0

=head2 freq

Show frequencies

Default: 0

=head2 interval

Show note intervals

Default: 0

=head2 prime

Show prime factorization

Default: 0

=head2 size

Chord size

Default: 3

=head2 semitones

Number of notes in the scale

Default: 12

=head2 temper

Physical distance between notes

Default: semitones * 100 / log(2)

=head2 notes

The actual notes to use in the computation

Default: [ 1/1 5/4 3/2 ]  (C E G)

The list of notes may be any of the keys in the L<Music::Intervals::Ratio>
C<ratio> hashref.  This is very very long and contains useful intervals such as
those of the common scale and even the Pythagorean intervals, too.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

  $x = Music::Intervals->new(%arguments);

Create a new C<Music::Intervals> object.

=head2 process()

Do the actual computations!
